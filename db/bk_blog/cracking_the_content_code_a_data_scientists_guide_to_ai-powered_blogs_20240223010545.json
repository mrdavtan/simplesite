    "content": "I'd like to write a script to go out and webscrape for news, twitters, top headlines, and retrieve content from youtube videos, and online services and databases.\n\nBut first I'd like to flush out my concept.\n\nLet's call this one MeSeeks, the weird blue genie thing with an annoying voice from Rick & Morty. \n\nMeSeeks goes out every 15 minutes, browsing news, twitter feeds, etc...\nI guess I'd call this the headline feed.\n\nMaybe once a day, MeSeeks checks for new published AI papers, and summarizes new AI unveilings or launches of new products as a starter thread to deeper dives later.\nI'd call this the research feed.\n\nLet's think a realistic sequence of events.\n\nA trigger for MeSeeks can be something that happens in the news and MeSeeks takes note.\n\nMeSeeks can search the web, take screen captures of search and image results, and document the findings in a report. This report is used by another agent to decide on the priority of creating content about this event or news.\n\nAnother trigger that I believe is more valuable are the findings of interesting tweets, and developing an 'intuition' or taste as an LLM as to what is worthy of capturing for development. There are specific things that I would look for in a post. The LLMs can learn and develop a filter on what to dig more into or ignore. The idea here is developing insight, and getting a sense of finding useful information and predicting why it might be useful, in contrast to reacting to something and regurgitating it.\n\nDuring the day, and at the end of the day, I see a list of headlines and images on my dashboard, each with summaries, and a list of insights on what is happening, why and perhaps a score for different aspects of the information.  \n\nAnother agent has gone through the list and scored these topics, triaged them and prioritized a handful. \n\nEach will likely be at least a blog if it lines up with the overall theme of the blog.\n\nIf the agent decides that there is value in expanding on the topic, each of these is then expanded into a longer form of writing, or tutorial, or essay with images, with well defined keywords based on research. \n\nThis content can be turned into a digital downloadable product, and it can be turned into a video or a number of videos.\n\nEach will go through a filtering and editing process, sometimes involving mixture of expert agents. The goal is to produce very high quality content for a specific niche.\n\nMeSeeks will only answer to the person who gave it the job and he will not stop until he finishes the task. MeSeeks can call on other MeSeeks to finish a task more quickly. We are talking here potentially about having other LLM AI instances spun up on the cloud by an AI.\n\nThe content can be improved over time, comments can be included in the versioning. People could contribute. Or their AI's could.\n\nI would like to have a bounty system, to invite other people or their AI's to help out.\n\nEssentially, I'm describing an automated system to create content, blogs, videos,.\n\nThe content it creates must be highly valuable to a specific group.\n\nOK. I'm sharing this with you because you are a systems architect full stack developer. All the activities of these AI should be tracked and documented for their own review and refinement of processes. \n\nWhat other aspects am I missing and what crazy ideas do you have that could make this an awesome fun project to work on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 / 2\nChatGPT\n\nYour concept for \"MeSeeks\" is ambitious and innovative, leveraging AI to not only aggregate and filter content but also to predict and evaluate its relevance and potential interest to a target audience. This approach combines several advanced AI and software development techniques. Here are some aspects to consider and ideas to potentially enhance your project:\n1. Ethical and Legal Considerations\n\n    Content Rights and Data Privacy: Ensure you're compliant with copyright laws, especially when scraping content and using tweets or YouTube videos. Implementing mechanisms to respect data privacy and copyright will be crucial.\n    Bias and Fairness: AI algorithms can inadvertently propagate biases present in their training data. It's important to continuously monitor and adjust your models to mitigate these biases.\n\n2. Technical Architecture and Scalability\n\n    Microservices Architecture: Consider structuring your application as a series of microservices. This approach can help in managing different functionalities (e.g., web scraping, content summarization, sentiment analysis) independently and scaling them as needed.\n    Cloud Computing and Scalability: Utilize cloud services for computational tasks, especially for AI model inferences and data storage. Cloud services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions can be effective for handling spikes in workload.\n\n3. AI and Machine Learning\n\n    NLP for Content Summarization and Sentiment Analysis: Use advanced NLP models for summarizing AI papers and news articles. Sentiment analysis can help in understanding public perception towards certain topics.\n    Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis: Implement machine learning models to predict the potential interest or impact of certain news items or tweets. This could involve training models on historical data to recognize patterns that indicate high engagement or relevance.\n\n4. User Interaction and Engagement\n\n    Dashboard for Visualization: Develop a user-friendly dashboard that provides a real-time view of the headlines, research feeds, and insights generated by MeSeeks. This could include analytics on content performance and user engagement.\n    Interactive Features: Allow users to provide feedback on the content generated, suggest topics, or even submit their own content for analysis. This could help in refining the AI models and making the content more relevant.\n\n5. Collaboration and Community Building\n\n    Bounty System and Collaboration: Implementing a bounty system for content creation and refinement can encourage participation from a wider community. This could involve gamification elements to make the process more engaging.\n    Version Control and Contribution Tracking: Use version control systems to track contributions and changes to the content. This could facilitate collaboration among different users and AI agents, making it easier to iterate and improve content over time.\n\n6. Innovative Features and Crazy Ideas\n\n    AI Personalities: Introduce different \"personalities\" or profiles for MeSeeks based on specific domains or interests, making the content curation more tailored and engaging.\n    Virtual Reality (VR) Content Exploration: Explore integrating VR experiences where users can interact with content in a more immersive way. This could be particularly engaging for educational content or in-depth analyses.\n    Blockchain for Content Authenticity: Use blockchain technology to certify the authenticity of the content generated and track its usage or modifications. This could add a layer of trust and transparency, especially for educational or research materials.\n\n7. Monitoring and Feedback Loop\n\n    Continuous Learning and Adaptation: Implement mechanisms for MeSeeks to learn from the content that engages users the most, using this feedback to refine content selection and generation processes.\n    A/B Testing Framework: Regularly test different algorithms, content formats, and presentation styles to see what resonates best with your audience. Use this data to continuously improve the system.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe success of MeSeeks will hinge not just on the technical execution but also on navigating ethical considerations, user engagement, and continuous adaptation to the evolving digital content landscape. Incorporating community feedback, ensuring scalability, and leveraging the latest advancements in AI and cloud computing will be key. This project has the potential to not only automate content creation but also significantly enhance the way we consume and interact with digital content.\nUser\nIf this were to become a blog post, can you come up with a cool click bait title that no person will be able to stop from clicking? and can you write a short description for it.\n\nFinally, can you come up with a really cool prompt to create a visual hero image for this blog post? \nChatGPT\nClickbait Title:\n\n\"Unleash Your Own AI Genie: The Secret Behind Automated Viral Content Creation!\"\nShort Description:\n\nDiscover the future of digital content as we unveil \"MeSeeks,\" the revolutionary AI that's changing the game.
